  "welcome.popup.createGroups.content3": "We encourage you to be as granular as possible with Groups and Subgroups. The reason for this is that with a granular division of Subscribers into Groups, you can ensure that each notification is targeted as specific as possible and cut down on subscribers receiving irrelevant notifications.",

  "welcome.popup.buildSubscribers.content1": "Throughout the NotifyMe system, we refer to the people who subscribe to your notifications as subscribers.  This nomenclature does not fit all organizational scenarios but it is generally accurate (e.g. You send out Notifications to your groups of subscribers and they receive them).",
  "welcome.popup.buildSubscribers.content2": "We also like to refer to them as constituents and people because you should view them as anyone who should be interested in hearing from you. These people could include employees, customers, investors, suppliers and members of the general public. However, for the sake of consistency, we have adopted “Subscribers” to refer to everyone using the NotifyMe app and receiving your notifications.",

First, you’ll have to create the role. You can do this by clicking on Roles and Permissions in Settings and create the Role of type Author.  Give the role a name, choose the groups to which this role can send notifications and then verify the default permissions.  This should take a minute or less.",

Ideally, if the administrator wants to efficiently get all teachers involved, an author role would be created for each grade level (e.g. Second Grade Teacher) and be granted group privileges for all subscribers to that grade level (e.g. Students, Parents, Second Grade Teachers, etc).",
  "welcome.popup.inviteTeam.content9": "NotifyMe supports multiple roles being assigned to one person. So, if your second-grade teacher is also the golf coach, then create both roles, grant permissions to the correct groups (e.g. Second Grade Students, Second Grade Parents,  Golf Team Players, Golf Team Managers, etc) and assign both roles to the team member.",

  "welcome.popup.inviteSubscribers.content4": "If you are ready to send out the invitation, click on the Publish button.  When you click on the Publish button, the system sends out the invitations via email or SMS, depending upon the contact data for each imported subscriber.  If the imported subscriber contains both email address and phone number for a subscriber, then that person will receive the invite in both ways.  Likewise, if the subscriber data contains only email address or phone number, then that subscriber will receive the invite via email or SMS, respectively.",
  "welcome.popup.inviteSubscribers.content5": "Once they receive the invite, they can easily install the app vie the embedded intelligent deep link.  If they do not yet have the NotifyMe app, then they’ll be directed to the correct app marketplace depending on their device type.

They can change these language settings at any time.",

For example, let's say that you have employees who have subgroups such as Sales, Accounting, Management, etc. Each of these subgroups should have their own file.
